# Tandem Code Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with the [Tandem Challenge Create React App Template](https://github.com/MrLoh/cra-template-tandem-challenge).

## Mock API

The template provides a [Mirage](https://miragejs.com) mock APi which is seeded with 2 data sets with ids "1234" and "4321". Mirage will intercept any requests, so you fetch data by simply using `fetch('/data-set/1234')` for example. There is also a POST endpoint provided, see `src/mockServer.test.ts` for more information.

## Available Scripts

Otherwise this is a regular Create React App project with typescript.

Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Run `yarn test` to run the tests, [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/) is already set up.

## Guidance

The appearance of the app and implementation approach are up to you. Try to keep the dependencies to a minimum and focus on a clean and readable implementation.

The code challenge should take between 2 and 6 hours. Please track you time, commit regularly, and don't over engineer the solution (a kitchen sink approach will not impress us). Prioritize your time on what you think are the most important aspects (there is no right or wrong answer) and document your decisions in the readme. If you need extra time for cleanup, documentation, or to fix bugs, that is fine.
